### Issue tracking
---
 - Strongly suggested using zenhub
 	https://www.zenhub.com/
 - Feel free to open new issue or take on existing issues in the backlog.
 - New issues will be sorted into backlog or ice box(to be done later).
 - Beginners may want to solve the issues with "newbies" tags, which is easier and will help you understand the framework.

### Newbie guidelines
---
 - Install zenhub
 - Go to "Board" and pick a newbies issue
 - Fork repo
 - Pull from dev branch
 - Fix the config problem mentioned above
 - Make your changes(solve the issue)
 - Send pull request
 
### Note
 ---
  - Our work flow is based on git flow but less complicated, more like git flow + github flow.
  - That is to say, even the PRs are accepted, they won't be released immediately. Your changes will be merged into dev not master, waiting for the next version upgrade to be released.
  - Good to know:
  	- git flow
